# WikiCrawler
Web crawler to pull information from Wikipedia pages

This project started with the goal of automatically populating a database with information about books and authors from wikipedia for my bookstore project.  This scraper worked well and is currently being used for other school projects with the same goal in mind: create a few thousand db entires to simulate a production database without resorting to dummy data.
